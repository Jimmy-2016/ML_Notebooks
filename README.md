This is repo that contains some notebooks related to ML methods and data analytics


(1) ML Methods that have been implemented from scratch
  K-Means, PCA, IsolatedForrest, Gradient Boosting
  
(2) Anomaly detection methods:
  Unsupervised (PCA, tSNE, UMAP, GMM, DBSCAN, Mahabolis, Isolted Forrest, LOF, OneClass SVM)
  Unbalanced Dataset (SMOTE, XGBOOST and random forest with class weight, EasyEnsembleClassifier, BalancedRandomForestClassifier)
  Deep Learning Methods: Fully connected Network with class weight, AutoEncoder
  
(3) Playing with Pandas to manipulate data, we would go nuts here and try everything. 
tasks are mainly based on Leetcode Pandas tasks
